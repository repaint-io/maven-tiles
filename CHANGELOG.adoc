== 1.3 - 2014-09-24

=== Added
- Apache Maven configuration parameter defintions for IDE support.
  This prevents IDEs such as IntelliJ IDEA from reporting `<tiles>`
  as being unexpected content.

=== Changed
- Added fallback support for Apache Maven 3.0.x. Primarilly to support
  working within IntelliJ IDEA which embeds 3.0.x. This means that tiles
  based projects resolve correctly in the IDE correctly, once again letting you
  _develop with pleasure_.


== 1.2 - 2014-09-23

=== Changed
- Fixed faulty merging of `<dependencyManagement>` sections from parent POMs
  when the tiles plugin was included in your project POM.
