All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

== 2.2 - PENDING

=== Added

- GAV tile references can now specify the artifact type to use ( for
  legacy tiles, or those deployed via other means ) in the form of
  `groupId:artifact:type:versionrange`.
- Added support for inherited version/groupId

=== Changed

- Maven Tiles Lifecycle now prevents execution with submodules, this is
 to prevent breaking support of -pl, -am, and -amd usage from Apache Maven.
 This also serves to drive one away from parents, forcing one mix in the tiles
 at the artifact level.
- The `attach-tile` goal now _correctly_ attaches the tile as the primary
  artifact for a `tile` packaged project, and merely as a `tile' artifact
  with a `.xml` extension for other packaging types.
- GAV specification now looks for a `.xml` artifact with an empty classifier
  or one with a specific extension/classifier.
- Updated to use Groovy 2.4.1

== 2.1 - 2015-01-13

=== Added

- GAV tile references can now specify the artifact type to use ( for
  legacy tiles, or those deployed via other means ) in the form of
  `groupId:artifact:type:versionrange`.
- Added support for inherited version/groupId

=== Changed

- The `attach-tile` goal now attaches tiles as the artifact type `tile`. This
  prevents services like oss.sonatype.org from doing full POM validation
  checks and dying.
- `tile` is now the default artifact type for resolution.
- Updated to use Groovy 2.3.9

== 1.8 - 2014-11-17

=== Added
- The `attach-tile` goal now understands a new `filtering` configuration
  property which will enable standard Maven resource processing for your tile.
  This enables refering to such things as `@project.version@` which will be
  resolved at install/deploy time. This is primarily useful for use in
  conjunction with including the tiles plugin in an existing project.

=== Changed
- The `attach-tile` goal no longer enforces the use of the `tile` packaging.
  This means you can easily add an `<execution>` definition and include
  the `tiles-maven-plugin` directly in existing projects to attach tiles,
  rather than using the `build-helper-maven-plugin`.

== 1.7 - 2014-10-10

=== Added
- When a tile is merged into the build, any plugin execution id's defined
  now get prepended with the tile's GAV reference. This allows for
  better understanding of what's happening in your build when looking
  at a build log file. Very useful for debugging/diagnosing oddities
  with your build process.

=== Changed
- The logging around what tiles are being injected into your project as
  parents has been cleaned up and improved.
- We've removed the copying/updating of the `<parent>` in the effective
  POM Model - this was causing issues with IntelliJ projects that
  contained both the tile, and an artifact _using_ that tile. Due to the
  maven server being reused over all IntelliJ Modules, and that IntelliJ
  assumes a parents artifact type is always `pom` and not `tile`,
  a circular reference was being reported to the IDE. As the effective
  model has already been resolved, this change does not actually effect
  the build process at all.
- `<distributionManagement>` wasn't being merged from tile models at all.
  This was preventing the implementation of a standard 'release' style
  tile.

== 1.6 - 2014-10-02

=== Changed
- We broke Maven 3.0.x ( and thus, IntelliJ ) support again with the changes
  to the thunked inheritance merger. Further investigation reveals this
  behaviour is broken under Maven even without tiles, but only affects the
  effective-pom - so has been removed.

== 1.5 - 2014-10-01

=== Changed
- When 1.4 switched to the new 'parental guidance' model of applying
  tiles, we unfortunately missed a critical step of applying activated
  and deactivate profiles, as well as the superpom. This meant that
  all unconfigured plugins simply..... vanished.
- As part of the above change, a problem dating back to 1.3 where
  `<configuration>` blocks that were not inside a plugins `<execution>`
  block were not correctly being applied to the plugin.

== 1.4 - 2014-09-29

=== Added
- The Maven Tiles Plugin now supports `<pluginManagement>` and `<profiles>`
  declared inside of a tile.


=== Changed
- Major internal reworking of how tiles are applied. Each tile is now
  injected into your POM's Model as a parent artifact, with your `pom.xml`'s
  original parent being used as the top level parent of the root tile.
- `<buildSmells>` configuration is now used at tile release time.

== 1.3 - 2014-09-24

=== Added
- Apache Maven configuration parameter defintions for IDE support.
  This prevents IDEs such as IntelliJ IDEA from reporting `<tiles>`
  as being unexpected content.

=== Changed
- Added fallback support for Apache Maven 3.0.x. Primarilly to support
  working within IntelliJ IDEA which embeds 3.0.x. This means that tiles
  based projects resolve in the IDE correctly, once again letting you
  _develop with pleasure_.


== 1.2 - 2014-09-23

=== Changed
- Fixed faulty merging of `<dependencyManagement>` sections from parent POMs
  when the tiles plugin was included in your project POM.
