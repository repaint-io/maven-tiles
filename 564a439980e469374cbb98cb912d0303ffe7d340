The point of tiles is to move OFF inheritance as far as the build is concerned.\n\nPretty much any problem arising from a multi-module build IS a reactor build problem, or how IntelliJ/Eclipse loads multiple projects into single instance of a Maven Server.\n\nThey will however, be given less priority.
