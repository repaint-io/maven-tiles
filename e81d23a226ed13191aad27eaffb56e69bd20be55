      "message": "I\u0027ve been thinking about this patch over the Xmas/New Year break and finally getting around to looking at it again.\n\nI\u0027m wondering tho - I\u0027m open to allowing/disallowing snapshots and the functionality here, but I\u0027m not sure I want to play with modifying the basic POM syntax - not without acknowledging that we\u0027re doing something.... nasty here.  \n\nWe already have a means for tracking this with the \"smells\" settings, I wonder if adding something like \"rangemanipulation\" as a tile-smell might be a good idea here, without enabling that smell if we add allowSnapshots to any tile - the build of the tile fails - similar to adding dependencies etc.\n\nIt\u0027s a small thing, but just adds a small measure of double opt-in that we\u0027re doing something that\u0027s not just the standard parent-manipulation of Apache Maven.",
