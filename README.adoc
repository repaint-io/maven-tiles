= Tiles Maven Plugin - Version 2.5

== Overview

The _tiles-maven-plugin_ is a Maven Plugin that tries to bringing the *composition* that is available to
dependencies to the parent structure as well.

== How do I make a Maven Tile?

Tiles are https://github.com/maoo/maven-tiles-examples/tree/master/tiles[plain Maven pom artifacts] which contain
parts of a Maven POM; every tile can contain

- build data, for example the license tags that a company wants to report on all their artifacts
- build aspects, for example the configurations of a plugin, such as Groovy, Java or Clojure.
- release aspects, for example the distribution management section
- references to other tiles

This could, for example, allow you to have build aspects consistent across your organisation and open sourced, and the
distribution of internal vs external artifacts kept in a single tile. In the current single parent hierarchy, this
is all duplicated.

== Where can't I use a Maven Tile?

The following are Repaint project definitions:

- *define: reactor build* - pom.xml that contains only modules, no plugins,
  no dependencies, no dependency management, no plugin management. These are used as shortcuts to get your full project
  installed or tested.
- *define: multi-module build* - pom.xml that contains plugins and/or dependencies, dependency management, plugin management

With those defined:

- You can use a tile in a reactor or multi-module build where the tile is a module and (a) only used in the
  other modules or (b) used in the parent with the inherits config turned off (so it is not inherited by the children).
  This is a side effect of how Maven works and we cannot work around it.
- We do not prioritize issues raised where you are using a multi-module build. These are the
  anti-thesis of Repaint.IO's philosophy of composition over inheritance. If you raise the issue and it seems a
  reasonable use case we will look at it, but please be aware that it is unlikely to be looked at by us without an
  explicit reproducible test case.

== Composing a Maven Tile

A Maven Tile is made up of a pom.xml and a tile.xml. The pom.xml contains the normal release information. When using
tiles, this would be the name/groupId/artifactId/version/description/packaging(tile) and generally only a declaration
of the Maven Tiles plugin. Only if you are using a tile (and generally you use at least one - the release tile) will
you specify a configuration.

[source,xml,indent=0]
.pom.xml
----
<project>
  <groupId>io.repaint.maven</groupId>
  <artifactId>license-tile</artifactId>
  <version>1.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
  <packaging>tile</packaging>
  <description>Contains consistent license information.</description>

  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>io.repaint.maven</groupId>
        <artifactId>tiles-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>2.5</version>
        <extensions>true</extensions>
        <configuration>
          <filtering>false</filtering>
          <tiles>
            <tile>io.repaint.tiles:github-release-tile:[1.1, 2)</tile>
          </tiles>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
----

With the packaging _tile_, the plugin will look for the attached tile.xml, do some basic validation on it and
attach it as an artifact.

When the `<filtering>` configuration item is specified as `true` - then standard Maven resource filtering
for `@project.version@` style references is applied to the `tile.xml` file prior to install/deploy.

A tile can define the tiles plugin if it wishes to cascade tile inclusion, or it can use the extended tile.xml syntax:

[source,xml,indent=0]
.tile.xml
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project>
  <licenses>
    <license>
      <name>The Apache Software License, Version 2.0</name>

    </license>
  </licenses>

  <tiles>
    <tile>io.repaint.tiles:ratpack-tile:[1,2)</tile>
  </tiles>

</project>
----

Although this will appear to not validate when editing in an IDE, the tile plugin will strip off the tiles
section when processing and use it directly.

== Build Smells

When migrating from a parent structure, it is worthwhile to take the opportunity to reduce your build smells. You
can do this gradually or in one go, depending on how your builds are done. By default, the plugin will strip all bad
smells. The following is an explanation of what is stripped and why those smells are bad. Richard and Mark will be
putting together a short book with tutorials for a better approach to building using Maven, but this is the short
explanation. Note, these are only cleaned from the tile.xml, not from your pom.xml.

- *dependencymanagement* - this was always a poor substitute for composite poms. Composite poms - aka a pom only release
artifact that stores all related dependencies together. This allows your project to pull in only those dependencies
 that it actually requires for release, and allow them to be directly overridden. Dependency management is only
 for declaring the version of an artifact, and not that it is a dependency - it is better and more composable to
 declare this specifically in a composite pom instead. Use version ranges so changes flow through.
- *pluginrepositories* and *repositories* - see http://blog.sonatype.com/2009/02/why-putting-repositories-in-your-poms-is-a-bad-idea/[Repositories in POMs is a bad idea] - this has always
been a bad idea. Get rid of it as soon as possible.
- *dependencies* - putting them in a parent or tile prevents your user from exclusion, again composites are a much, much
better idea here. Just don't use this section anywhere other than your actual artifact or composite poms.

Almost made a build smell:
- pluginmanagement - plugin management is used in parents to define all of the necessary options for a plugin but
not have that plugin actually run during the release of the parent artifact, and also give the child the option of
running it. The reason this is bad is that it is mostly not necessary. You should split your plugins up into tiles
so that they be pulled into a build as a standalone set of functionality that will always run and be properly configured.
Since they will reside in the tile.xml file, they will not be run when the tile is released. However, some plugins are
never run automatically - release and enforcer are two examples. These make sense to stay in pluginManagement.


If you need to use them, add them to your configuration section:

[source,xml,indent=0]
.pom.xml
----
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>io.repaint.maven</groupId>
      <artifactId>tiles-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>2.5</version>
      <configuration>
        <buildSmells>dependencymanagement, dependencies, repositories, pluginrepositories</buildSmells>
        <tiles>
           <tile>groupid:antrun1-tile:1.1-SNAPSHOT</tile>
           <tile>groupid:antrun2-tile:1.1-SNAPSHOT</tile>
        </tiles>
      </configuration>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
----

== Composing Build functionality

As a use case, an example of how it will be used for my projects.

Richard will have:

- *java6-tile* - for those projects that have to remain Java 6
- *java7-tile* - for those projects that haven't yet moved to Java 8
- *java8-tile* - for those projects that are on Java 8
- *groovy-tile* - which defines the build structure necessary to build a Groovy project, including GMavenPlus, GroovyDoc
and Source plugins
- *java-tile* - for Java only projects which include all the Javadoc and Source plugins
- *s3-tile* - for our Servlet3 modules, which includes Sass, JSP compilation and Karma plugins and depends on the groovy-tile
- *github-release-tile* - for artifacts that release to Github (open source)
- *nexus-release-tile* - for artifacts that release to our local Nexus (not open source)


This allows me to open source all my tiles except for the nexus tile, and then decide in the final artifact where I will
release it.

== Mojos

There are two mojos in the plugin, attach-tile and validate. attach-tile is only used by the deploy/install
process and attaches the tile.xml. validate is for your use to ensure your tile is valid before releasing it - this
ensures it can be read and any errors or warnings about content will appear.

== Additional Notes

Some interesting notes:

- Tiles support version ranges, so use them. [1.1, 2) allows you to update and release new versions of tiles and have them
propagate out. Maven 3.2.2 allows this with the version ranges in parents, but it isn't a good solution because of single
inheritance.
- You can include as many tiles as you like in a pom and poms can refer to other tiles. The plugin will search through
the poms, telling you which ones it is picking up and then load their configurations in *reverse order*. This means the
poms _closer_ to your artifact get their definitions being the most important ones. If you have duplicate plugins, the one
closest to your pom wins.
- String interpolation for properties works. The plugin first walks the tree of tiles collecting all properties, merges them
together (closest wins), and then reloads the poms and interpolates them. This means all string replacement in plugins and
dependencies works as expected.
- Plugin execution is merged - if you have the same plugin in two different tiles define two different executions, they will
merge.
- The plugin works fine with alternative packaging. It has been tested with war, grails-plugin and grails-app.


== Final Notes

Tiles-Maven works best when *you* and *your team* own the tiles. I don't recommend relying on open source tiles, always
create your own versions and always lock down versions of third party tiles, just like you would third party dependencies.
