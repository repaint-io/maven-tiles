      "message": "I wonder if a simpler model/approach to this is to specifically apply the tiles after OR before the declared parent, rather than any arbitrary parent ( which this patch doesn\u0027t check if it exists - I think? ).\n\nIf we changed the property to be just a boolean, and if \"applyAfterParent\" is true, would just changing these two lines to:\n\nParent originalParent \u003d pomModel.parent?.parent\nModel lastPom \u003d pomModel.parent\n\nwork?  We\u0027d need to modify the lastPomFile defined below as well. That would solve your needs I believe and not add extra complications to check the parent actually exists etc.\n\nIf this worked, we probably wouldn\u0027t actually need any of the changes in thunkModelBuilder() right? Which would make this change incredibly more simpler...",
