- Added support explicit merging of tiles execution configuration - Rob Bygrave

== 2.15

- Reintroduced tiles-keep-id as attribute which was removed by mistake - brian.vella

== 2.14

- Fail tile validation if <build><extensions> is present
- Fail tile validation when a plugin includes <extensions>
- Allow a version property that evaluates as empty so it can be replaced by a plugin (potentially in a tile) later.
- Filter tiles in reactor during tile injection to avoid using unfiltered properties
- Resolve tile dependency version to the non-range value of it's lower-bound when injecting tiles as dependencies

== 2.13

- Remove unneeded org.codehaus.plexus.logging.Logger re-definition.
- Fixed rewriting execution ids and rewrite them in profiles as well
- Load tile from repositories declared in pom / settings instead of always from central
- Inject tiles as dependencies. This is purely optional, requires .mvn/extensions.xml with the gav of this plugin to work.

== 2.12

- Evaluate property substitution when processing pom parents and the applyBefore configuration directive.
- Perform property substitution in version numbers before merging tiles to pickup CI Friendly version numbers.
- Copy reporting plugins when copying tile for merging.

== 2.10

- Updated to Groovy 2.4.8 - now works under JDK 9

- Fixed interpolation of env.XXX properties

== 2.8

- Updated to Groovy 2.4.6
- Optionally apply tiles to specific parent. By default, tiles are injected as parents of
  the primary Maven Project, the `applyBefore` configuration property can now be used to define
  a partial GAV ( groupId:artifactId ) to declare a injection target.
- Reset source/test directories after processing tiles to detect assignment inside tiles.
- Added Gittr Chat at https://gitter.im/repaint-io/maven-tiles
- Restore original ModelProcessor after processing ( fixes issues with M2E and Eclipse )
- Copy groupId/version from original parent if inherited (Fixes #47)
- Optionally supress title plugin's execution id rewriting (Fixes #12)

Thanks to contributions from Erwin Tratar for making this release.

== 2.7

- Clear collected tiles before processing each project in reactor.
+
Removes warning for duplicate tiles in reactor builds and fixes
bad behaviour if projects in reactor don't use the same set of tiles.

== 2.6

- When resolving tile artifacts, we were only resolving the .xml tile artifact
  and not it's .pom artifact as well, this caused resolution issues with the
  flatten plugin ( among others ) when the artifact didn't exist in your
  local ``~/.m2/repository`.

== 2.5

=== Added

- If something is trying to use the MavenBuilder, because we remain in the lifecycle
 they were requesting the tile parents and because they were of type "tile" they
 were not being accepted by plugins that wanted "pom" parents (which is perfectly reasonable). This
 particularly affected the flatten plugin. There is a change in the smack-talk we introduce
 to ensure that tile models are returned as pom models.
- Mixed in tiles were not appearing as distribution management early enough, so now after
 the resolution of a project's model, we check if there is a distribution management section
 and insert it into the MavenProject so the Deploy plugin can pick it up. Much like the deploy
 plugin does for supporting overrides.

== 2.2

=== Added

- GAV tile references can now specify the artifact type to use ( for
  legacy tiles, or those deployed via other means ) in the form of
  `groupId:artifact:type:versionrange`.
- Added support for inherited version/groupId

=== Changed

- Maven Tiles Lifecycle now prevents execution with submodules, this is
 to prevent breaking support of -pl, -am, and -amd usage from Apache Maven.
 This also serves to drive one away from parents, forcing one mix in the tiles
 at the artifact level.
- The `attach-tile` goal now _correctly_ attaches the tile as the primary
  artifact for a `tile` packaged project, and merely as a `tile' artifact
  with a `.xml` extension for other packaging types.
- GAV specification now looks for a `.xml` artifact with an empty classifier
  or one with a specific extension/classifier.
- Updated to use Groovy 2.4.1

== 2.1 - 2015-01-13

=== Added

- GAV tile references can now specify the artifact type to use ( for
  legacy tiles, or those deployed via other means ) in the form of
  `groupId:artifact:type:versionrange`.
- Added support for inherited version/groupId

=== Changed

- The `attach-tile` goal now attaches tiles as the artifact type `tile`. This
  prevents services like oss.sonatype.org from doing full POM validation
  checks and dying.
- `tile` is now the default artifact type for resolution.
- Updated to use Groovy 2.3.9

== 1.8 - 2014-11-17

=== Added
- The `attach-tile` goal now understands a new `filtering` configuration
  property which will enable standard Maven resource processing for your tile.
  This enables refering to such things as `@project.version@` which will be
  resolved at install/deploy time. This is primarily useful for use in
  conjunction with including the tiles plugin in an existing project.

=== Changed
- The `attach-tile` goal no longer enforces the use of the `tile` packaging.
  This means you can easily add an `<execution>` definition and include
  the `tiles-maven-plugin` directly in existing projects to attach tiles,
  rather than using the `build-helper-maven-plugin`.

== 1.7 - 2014-10-10

=== Added
- When a tile is merged into the build, any plugin execution id's defined
  now get prepended with the tile's GAV reference. This allows for
  better understanding of what's happening in your build when looking
  at a build log file. Very useful for debugging/diagnosing oddities
  with your build process.

=== Changed
- The logging around what tiles are being injected into your project as
  parents has been cleaned up and improved.
- We've removed the copying/updating of the `<parent>` in the effective
  POM Model - this was causing issues with IntelliJ projects that
  contained both the tile, and an artifact _using_ that tile. Due to the
  maven server being reused over all IntelliJ Modules, and that IntelliJ
  assumes a parents artifact type is always `pom` and not `tile`,
  a circular reference was being reported to the IDE. As the effective
  model has already been resolved, this change does not actually effect
  the build process at all.
- `<distributionManagement>` wasn't being merged from tile models at all.
  This was preventing the implementation of a standard 'release' style
  tile.

== 1.6 - 2014-10-02

=== Changed
- We broke Maven 3.0.x ( and thus, IntelliJ ) support again with the changes
  to the thunked inheritance merger. Further investigation reveals this
  behaviour is broken under Maven even without tiles, but only affects the
  effective-pom - so has been removed.

== 1.5 - 2014-10-01

=== Changed
- When 1.4 switched to the new 'parental guidance' model of applying
  tiles, we unfortunately missed a critical step of applying activated
  and deactivate profiles, as well as the superpom. This meant that
  all unconfigured plugins simply..... vanished.
- As part of the above change, a problem dating back to 1.3 where
  `<configuration>` blocks that were not inside a plugins `<execution>`
  block were not correctly being applied to the plugin.

== 1.4 - 2014-09-29

=== Added
- The Maven Tiles Plugin now supports `<pluginManagement>` and `<profiles>`
  declared inside of a tile.


=== Changed
- Major internal reworking of how tiles are applied. Each tile is now
  injected into your POM's Model as a parent artifact, with your `pom.xml`'s
  original parent being used as the top level parent of the root tile.
- `<buildSmells>` configuration is now used at tile release time.

== 1.3 - 2014-09-24

=== Added
- Apache Maven configuration parameter defintions for IDE support.
  This prevents IDEs such as IntelliJ IDEA from reporting `<tiles>`
  as being unexpected content.

=== Changed
- Added fallback support for Apache Maven 3.0.x. Primarilly to support
  working within IntelliJ IDEA which embeds 3.0.x. This means that tiles
  based projects resolve in the IDE correctly, once again letting you
  _develop with pleasure_.


== 1.2 - 2014-09-23

=== Changed
- Fixed faulty merging of `<dependencyManagement>` sections from parent POMs
  when the tiles plugin was included in your project POM.
